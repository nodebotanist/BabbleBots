# BabbleBots

BabbleBots is meant to be a library that allows you to declaratively write a thin client for IoT devices-- so you can easily connect them to a Node/Python/Ruby/Go/Whatever server. It's basically a tool so that I don't have to keep writing thin clients for my devices, and so others can make thin-client NodeBots without having to deal with C.

## Goals

* Declare a JSON schema representing your bot, and BabbleBots spits out a language-appropriate file
* Start with Particle Photon/Core support, but add in later:
    * Electric Imp
* Unit tests, unit tests everywhere

# Versioning

0.0.0 -- I have the files set up. Like, the .gitignore and the README. Nothing is here except my goals and the idea (written in JFK after 20 pages of written brainstorming on a plane.)
